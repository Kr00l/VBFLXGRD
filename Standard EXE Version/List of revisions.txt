List of revisions:

03-May-2021
- Removed WS_EX_NOPARENTNOTIFY in the window creation as this causes a MDI child window to not get activated.

26-Mar-2021
- UserControl.DrawStyle set to 5 = Transparent to avoid a wasted/unused GDI pen handle.

17-Mar-2021

  This behavior is now the same as in a VB.Form's TextHeight/TextWidth function.

28-Feb-2021
- Included new enum 'FlexMousePointerConstants' which the MousePointer property now uses.
  Reason is that the VBA environment does not support IPerPropertyBrowsing.

    Polyline is at device driver level, thus faster than LineTo and it doesn't change current position.
  - ~1% for using of PatBlt API instead of FillRect. (FillRect is a wrapper of PatBlt SelectObject'ing the specified Brush)
  - ~5% by preserving the memory bitmap (DoubleBuffer) for WM_PAINT and re-create only upon WM_SIZE.

26-Apr-2020
- Bugfix in the GetClipboardText function in Common.bas.

19-Apr-2020

- Bugfix in the CellPicture property. It now returns as 'IPictureDisp' instead of 'IPicture'.

05-Jan-2020
- Improvement in VTableHandle.bas as IPerPropertyBrowsing must NOT be subclassed anymore.
  No VTable remains subclassed, therefore VTableSubclass.cls got obselete and was removed!
- Modified OLEGuids.tlb as following: (compiled with same uuid)
  - bugfix interface IPerPropertyBrowsing.
  Unregister to old OLEGuids.tlb is not necessary, just overwrite the file.

  But it applies only when there is any default button on the form.
